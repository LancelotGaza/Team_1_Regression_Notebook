# Team_1_Regression_Notebook

This notebook consists of our attempt at the Sendy Logistics Challenge on https://zindi.africa/.

We will be training a regression model that will be used to predict the estimated time of arrival for motorbike deliveries in Kenya-Nairobi, from explanatory features. In this notebook, we go through the whole process of creating a machine learning model based on the dataset provided by Sendy found on https://zindi.africa/hackathons/edsa-2021-sendy-logistics-challenge/data, which consists of order details and rider metrics based on orders made on the Sendy platform.

Our main challenge is to predict the estimated time of arrival for orders - from pick-up to drop-off.
